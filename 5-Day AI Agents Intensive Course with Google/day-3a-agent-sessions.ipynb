It's one of the most dynamic areas where AI is making a significant impact. Here are some of the key trends and recent advancements:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n    *   **De Novo Design:** This is a huge area. Instead of screening existing libraries, generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based models) can now *create entirely new molecular structures* from scratch. These molecules are designed to have specific properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, desired ADMET properties).\n    *   **Optimizing Existing Molecules:** AI can also take a known molecule and suggest modifications to improve its potency, reduce toxicity, or enhance its pharmacokinetic profile.\n\n**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n    *   **Uncovering New Disease Targets:** AI analyzes vast biological datasets (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify novel proteins or pathways that are causally linked to diseases. This moves beyond well-understood targets.\n    *   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI can help predict whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can effectively bind to it and modulate its activity.\n\n**3. Accelerating Preclinical Testing:**\n    *   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are getting better at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties of drug candidates *in silico* (on a computer). This allows researchers to filter out problematic molecules much earlier, saving significant time and resources.\n    *   **In Vitro to In Vivo Translation:** AI is being used to bridge the gap between lab experiments (in vitro) and animal studies (in vivo), helping to predict how a drug might behave in a living organism.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Screening Processes:**\n    *   **Virtual Screening Enhancements:** While virtual screening has been around for a while, AI is making it much more powerful. It can more intelligently prioritize compounds from massive chemical libraries for experimental testing, reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming physical screening.\n    *   **Active Learning:** AI systems learn from the results of experimental screenings and use that feedback to refine their search for promising compounds in subsequent rounds.\n\n**5. AI in Clinical Trial Design and Optimization (Related to Drug Discovery):**\n    *   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI can analyze historical trial data and patient characteristics to predict the likelihood of success for a new drug candidate in clinical trials.\n    *   **Patient Stratification:** Identifying specific patient subgroups who are most likely to benefit from a particular drug.\n\n**Companies and Initiatives Leading the Charge:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront of this revolution, often blending AI expertise with deep biological and chemical knowledge. Some prominent examples include:\n\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI and machine learning to map human genetics and cellular responses to discover new treatments.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Employs AI to analyze scientific literature and proprietary data for target identification and drug discovery.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on AI-driven drug design and development.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its end-to-end AI-driven drug discovery platform, including de novo molecule generation.\n*   **NVIDIA:** While not a drug discovery company itself, its powerful GPUs and AI platforms are crucial enablers for many AI drug discovery efforts.\n\n**Key Challenges and Future Directions:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** The effectiveness of AI heavily relies on high-quality, diverse, and comprehensive datasets.\n*   **Explainability:** Understanding *why* an AI model predicts a certain molecule will be effective remains a challenge.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation.\n*   **Integration with Wet Lab:** Seamlessly integrating AI-driven insights into traditional laboratory workflows is crucial for speed.\n*   **Regulatory Pathways:** Navigating the regulatory landscape for AI-discovered drugs is evolving.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just augmenting drug discovery; it's fundamentally transforming it by enabling the design of novel molecules, identifying new targets, and accelerating the entire R&D pipeline from early research to clinical trials. The pace of innovation is very high, with new breakthroughs and applications emerging regularly.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which was **AI for Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical step in drug discovery because without a clear understanding of the biological mechanism driving a disease, it's very difficult to develop an effective treatment.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing this area:\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nHistorically, identifying drug targets has been a labor-intensive process. Researchers would:\n*   Study known biological pathways.\n*   Observe changes in gene or protein expression in diseased vs. healthy states.\n*   Perform genetic screens to find genes linked to a disease.\n*   Rely on serendipity and decades of accumulated knowledge.\n\nThis process could be slow, prone to human bias, and often focused on well-trodden paths. It could also miss novel, less obvious targets.\n\n**How AI is Changing the Game for Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI excels at finding patterns and making connections in massive, complex datasets that are beyond human capacity to analyze manually. Here's how it's applied:\n\n1.  **Leveraging Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can integrate and analyze diverse biological data types simultaneously, such as:\n        *   **Genomics:** DNA sequences, mutations, gene variations.\n        *   **Transcriptomics:** RNA expression levels (which genes are active).\n        *   **Proteomics:** Protein levels and their interactions.\n        *   **Metabolomics:** Small molecule metabolites in cells or tissues.\n        *   **Epigenomics:** Modifications to DNA that affect gene expression.\n    *   **How AI helps:** By looking at how these layers of information change together in disease states, AI can pinpoint specific genes, proteins, or pathways that are *causally involved* in disease initiation or progression, not just correlated.\n\n2.  **Analyzing Scientific Literature and Databases:**\n    *   **What it is:** The volume of published scientific research is overwhelming. AI-powered Natural Language Processing (NLP) can \"read\" and understand vast amounts of scientific text.\n    *   **How AI helps:**\n        *   **Knowledge Graphs:** AI can build sophisticated knowledge graphs that map relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and biological processes. This helps identify unexpected links.\n        *   **Hypothesis Generation:** AI can identify emerging trends or novel connections in the literature that might suggest new targets. For example, it might notice a recurring theme about a specific protein's involvement in multiple diseases that were previously thought to be unrelated.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **What it is:** Identifying a target is one thing; finding a molecule that can bind to it and modulate its activity effectively is another.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI models can learn from the characteristics of known druggable targets and their respective drugs. They can then assess new potential targets and predict:\n        *   **Binding Site Characteristics:** Does the target have a pocket where a drug can bind?\n        *   **Specificity:** Is it likely that a drug will only bind to this target and not others (to avoid side effects)?\n        *   **Modulation Potential:** Can a molecule realistically alter the target's function (e.g., inhibit it, activate it)?\n\n4.  **In Silico Disease Modeling:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can help build complex computational models of diseases.\n    *   **How AI helps:** These models simulate cellular processes and disease progression. Researchers can then virtually \"perturb\" these models by altering specific genes or proteins to see which perturbations have the most significant impact on reversing disease phenotypes. These key perturbations often point to promising drug targets.\n\n**Impact and Significance:**\n\n*   **Broader Target Space:** AI allows exploration of a much wider range of potential targets, including \"undruggable\" targets that were previously overlooked.\n*   **Increased Precision:** By integrating multiple data types, AI can identify more specific and relevant targets, leading to more precise therapies with fewer off-target effects.\n*   **Faster Hypothesis Generation:** AI can generate testable hypotheses about new targets much more rapidly than traditional methods.\n*   **Reduced Failure Rates:** By validating targets early and predicting druggability, AI can help reduce the high failure rates in later stages of drug development.\n\n**Example Scenario:**\n\nImagine AI analyzing genomic data from thousands of lung cancer patients and correlating it with protein expression data and patient outcomes. It might identify a previously uncharacterized protein that is consistently overexpressed in aggressive forms of lung cancer and whose depletion in cell models slows tumor growth. This protein, previously not a focus, could then become a prime candidate for drug development.\n\nThis ability to sift through immense biological complexity and connect the dots is what makes AI so powerful for identifying and validating the fundamental biological drivers of disease, thereby setting the stage for successful drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about companies involved in **AI for Target Identification and Validation**.

They also offer platforms and software (like Clara) that support AI in life sciences, including drug discovery.\n*   **Cloud Providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure):** Provide the computational power and cloud infrastructure necessary for handling and processing the massive datasets involved.\n\n**Key Considerations When Looking at Companies:**\n\n*   **Breadth vs. Depth:** Some companies offer a full spectrum from target ID to clinical trials, while others might excel at one specific aspect, like mining literature or analyzing omics data.\n*   **Technology:** What kind of AI are they using? (e.g., deep learning, NLP, graph neural networks). What data sources do they prioritize?\n*   **Therapeutic Area Focus:** Some companies focus on oncology, others on neuroscience, rare diseases, etc.\n*   **Partnerships:** Many companies, both large and small, form strategic partnerships to leverage each other's expertise and data.\n\nThe landscape is very dynamic, with new startups emerging and established players constantly expanding their AI capabilities.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
